Let it cool completely - potatoes cooked in a hurry on the same day do not become a real salad!\n\nTo make a salad, peel boiled potatoes and chop into small cubes. Cut the boiled cooled eggs into small cubes or crush them with a fork. Chop the cucumber into small cubes. Chop the onion or leek very finely (if desired, soak the chopped onion in a little cold water, it will soften the taste). Chop the sausage into small cubes.\n\nThe sauce should be mixed in a separate bowl. Mix sour cream, mayonnaise and mustard. Add chopped dill, onion tops, salt and pepper (the more summertime, the more I add herbs). Pour the sauce over the salad ingredients and mix gently.\n\nBefore serving, let the salad season in the pantry for about 2-4 hours.",

Cook and stir onion and garlic in the hot oil until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add Arborio rice; cook, stirring frequently, until coated with oil, about 4 minutes. Stir 1/2 cup of the hot chicken broth into the saucepan; cook and stir until the rice has absorbed the broth, about 2 minutes. Repeat this process 4 more times, stirring constantly, until rice is creamy and tender yet firm to the bite, about 15 minutes. Stir shrimp and asparagus into the remaining hot broth. Cook until shrimp turns pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove broth from heat. Stir shrimp and asparagus into the rice; cook for 1 minute. Stir Parmesan cheese and butter into the rice; cook until melted, about 1 minute. Remove rice from heat. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle parsley over each serving.",
